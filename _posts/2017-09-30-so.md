## What's the holdup?
So I mentioned my hope that I would enjoy updating my new website in [my second post](https://davewhipp.github.io/articles/2017-02/why), then basically ignored the site for 7 months.
Not exactly what I had planned.


Life has been busy for the past several months, and is as busy as ever now.
I've had some unexpected travel, a bit of time away from work, and the subsequent crunch to catchup.
I'm still in favor of trying to update and post a bit more stuff here, and with a bit more frequency, but I'm going to have to lower the expectations a bit.
I'll focus for now on adding something interesting from time to time, about research, teaching, or other things I think might benefit someone online.
These posts may come every few months, or in clusters, but they'll appear when they do.
I still like the layout of the site and ease of posting with Markdown, I just don't think I'm going to become a bigtime blogger.
Not that I have time for that anyway.
